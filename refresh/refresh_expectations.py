# Shared engine that regenerates a mod's Scripts/expected-injections.json —
# the checked-in "sidecar" of every DefInjected key the live game expects for
# that mod — by driving the L10nProbe dev mod. Consumed by each mod repo via
# a thin Scripts/refresh-translation-expectations.py shim that sys.path-
# inserts this file's directory, imports it, assigns the config variables
# below by module attribute (e.g. `engine.PACKAGE_ID = "..."`), and calls
# main().
#
# Config variables a shim MUST set before calling main():
#   PACKAGE_ID            str        this mod's own packageId (About.xml)
#   CANONICAL_ACTIVE_MODS list[str]  pinned probe-boot mod list, load order,
#                                    probe's own packageId last
#
# The probe source lives beside this engine, at ../probe relative to this
# file (i.e. the rimworld-l10n checkout's probe/ directory) — see
# rimworld_path() below for the deploy check and its build instructions.
#
# The sidecar is what makes unknown localization-gap classes impossible by
# structure: check_translations.py (this engine's checker half) validates
# languages against it and refuses to run against stale expectations (any
# defName in Defs/ it has never seen), so every content change forces a
# regen, and the regen sees everything the game sees (vanilla-inherited
# fields, C# defaults) via the game's own walker,
# Verse.DefInjectionUtility.ForEachPossibleDefInjection.
#
# Flow: launch the game with -l10nprobe (graphical boot, ~1-2 min; the probe
# runs once defs are loaded, writes one JSON per configured mod, then quits
# the game), fetch this mod's dump from the probe's Output folder, rewrite the
# sidecar, print a key-level diff summary.
#
# The probe boots with a PINNED mod list (CANONICAL_ACTIVE_MODS), not
# whatever the user last played with: ModsConfig.xml is swapped for the run
# and restored afterwards. The dump reflects the LIVE def graph, so any
# third-party mod that patches our defs leaks into the expectations — a mod
# that reshuffles our defs' fields or hediff comps would show up in the dump
# even though it is not installed for most players. The pinned list is this
# mod + hard deps + every DLC our defs can MayRequire, matching the
# configuration the sidecar was first verified against.
#
# CANONICAL_ACTIVE_MODS membership rule (the same rule for every consuming
# repo; only the enumeration differs per mod):
#   * Core, plus every DLC the mod hard-requires or gates content behind via
#     MayRequire (a def whose gate is absent never loads, so its keys drop
#     out of the sidecar and its already-shipped translations turn illegal);
#   * hard third-party mod dependencies, and THEIR OWN transitive hard deps
#     (a dependency that itself fails to load properly changes the def graph
#     the probe walks);
#   * this mod, plus family siblings when their CANONICAL_ACTIVE_MODS lists
#     are deliberately kept identical on purpose (so one probe boot refreshes
#     every sidecar in the family and each repo's own --no-launch run can
#     reuse the shared dump — this is a convenience, not a correctness rule:
#     each sidecar is only ever validated against ITS OWN mod's content);
#   * a third-party mod ONLY if this mod's own content MayRequire's it.
# Nothing else. The probe filters each dump by packageId, so an extra mod
# adds no keys of its own — but its patches to OUR defs leak straight into
# the expectations (see incident note below).
#
# Operational warnings worth keeping in mind whenever CANONICAL_ACTIVE_MODS
# is edited:
#   * All ids LOWERCASE — the format RimWorld itself writes to ModsConfig.xml.
#     This is load-bearing, not cosmetic: mod *loading* tolerates mixed case,
#     but the MayRequire active-check is case-exact against the ModsConfig
#     strings, so a mixed-case entry here loads the mod yet silently drops
#     every def gated on it. Observed 2026-08-03: VanillaExpanded.VFEPower
#     loaded fine while every VFEPower-gated RecipeDef vanished from the dump.
#   * Pin deliberately, don't reuse a "whatever I was playing with" list: a
#     2026-08-03 run under a Combat Extended play list emitted CE's rebuilt
#     spear tools and reshuffled hediff comps, none of which exist for
#     players without CE — those keys would have shipped in the sidecar (and
#     from there, demanded of every translator) for a mod nobody but the
#     author had installed.
#
# Operational facts (verified against the probe's SPEC + live runs, 2026-07-31):
#   * The game's exit code is 0 even when probing fails — success is judged by
#     the output file, never the exit code.
#   * On per-mod failure the probe guarantees NO output file at that mod's
#     path (a pre-existing one is deleted). We delete the file before
#     launching anyway, so a leftover from an older run can't be mistaken for
#     a fresh result.
#   * meta.generated is the only field that changes between runs on identical
#     content, so it is stripped from the sidecar: an unchanged repo
#     regenerates to a byte-identical file and "git diff is empty" means
#     "nothing changed". meta.gameBuild is kept — a diff in it explains why
#     keys moved when no local def changed (vanilla update).
#
# Usage:
#   python3 Scripts/refresh-translation-expectations.py            # launch + refresh
#   python3 Scripts/refresh-translation-expectations.py --no-launch  # reuse the
#     dump already in the probe's Output folder (debugging / probe just ran)
